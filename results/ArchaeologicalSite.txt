The site is located just upstream from the merging of the Red River and the Black River near Việt Trì. A single radiocarbon dating sample from coffin wood that was exhumed from the site suggested that the artefacts were from the second phase of the Dong Son culture, estimated to be between 382 BCE and 195 BCE.</rdfs:comment>

The temples are dedicated to the worship of the god Shiva, known under various local names, the most important of which is Bhadreshvara. Mỹ Sơn is perhaps the longest inhabited archaeological site in Indochina, but a large majority of its architecture was destroyed by US bombing during a single week of the Vietnam War.</rdfs:comment>
