        rdfs:comment          "Re-education camps (Vietnamese: Trại cải tạo) were prison camps operated by the Communist government of Vietnam following the end of the Vietnam War. In these camps, the government imprisoned up to 300,000 former military officers, government workers and supporters of the former government of South Vietnam. Other estimates put the number of inmates who passed through \"re-education\" as high as 500,000 to 1 million. \"Re-education\" as it was implemented in Vietnam was seen as both a means of revenge and a sophisticated technique of repression and indoctrination, which developed following the 1975 Fall of Saigon. Thousands were tortured and abused. Prisoners were incarcerated for periods ranging from weeks to 18 years."@en ;
