dbr:Cổ_Loa_Citadel  rdfs:comment  "Cổ Loa Citadel (Vietnamese: Cổ Loa thành) is an important fortified settlement and archaeological site in present-day Hanoi's Dong Anh district, roughly 17 kilometers north of present-day Hanoi, in the upper plain north of the Hong River. Various relics of the Bronze Age Phung Nguyen culture and Dong Son culture have been found in Cổ Loa, although it was later established as the capital of Âu Lạc Kingdom during the 3rd century BCE (about 257 BCE). It might be the first political center of the Vietnamese civilization. The settlement’s concentric walls resemble a snail’s shell; it had an outer embankment covering 600 hectares."@en ;

dbr:Long_Biên  rdfs:comment   "Long Biên (Vietnamese), also known as Longbian (龙编; 龍編; Lóngbiān; Lung-pien < Eastern Han Chinese: *lioŋ-pian/pen; lit. \"Dragons Interweaving\") was the capital of the Chinese Jiao Province and Jiaozhi Commandery during the Han dynasty. It was located on the Red River in modern-day Bac Ninh. After Ly Bi's successful revolt in AD 544, it served as the capital of Van Xuan. When the Sui dynasty of China retook the territory in 603, the Sui general moved the capital to nearby Tống Bình. Long Biên flourished as a trading port in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. Thăng Long was founded in 1010 at the site of earlier Chinese fortresses nearby. This grew into modern Hanoi, which incorporated Long Biên as one of its districts."@en ;
