dbr:Bassac_River  rdfs:comment  "The Bassac River (Khmer: ទន្លេបាសាក់; Tonlé Bassac) is a distributary of the Tonlé Sap and Mekong River. The river starts in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and flows southerly, crossing the border into Vietnam near Châu Đốc. The name Bassac comes from the Khmer prefix “pa” (father or male) added to sak (សក្តិ) (power or honor), a Khmer word borrowed from the Sanskrit “sakti” (शक्ति). In Vietnam it is known as the Hậu River (Sông Hậu or Hậu Giang in Vietnamese). Three bridges span the Bassac: the Monivong and Takhmao bridges in Phnom Penh, Cambodia and the Cần Thơ Bridge in Cần Thơ in Vietnam."@en ;

dbr:Kiến_Giang_River  rdfs:comment  "The Kiến Giang River (Vietnamese: Sông Kiến Giang) is a river in Lệ Thủy District, Quảng Bình Province, North Central Coast, Vietnam. The length of the river is 58 km. It is a tributary of the Nhật Lệ River. The Kiến Giang River originates in the Annamite Range (Truong Son Range) where various streams add water to it. The upper part of this river is sloping, therefore rain water from Annamite Range flows violently to the lower part in rainy seasons (in autumn), causing floods in it basin. Thanks to An Ma Dam, this situation has been stopped. Unlike other rivers in Vietnam which flow southeast, the Kiến Giang River flows northeast, and creates a narrow delta in Lệ Thủy District. Like all of the rivers in Central Vietnam, this river water is clear, which means that it carries little alluvium"@en ;

dbr:Mekong  rdfs:comment      "The Mekong or Mekong River is a trans-boundary river in East Asia and Southeast Asia. It is the world's twelfth longest river and the sixth longest in Asia. Its estimated length is 4,909 km (3,050 mi), and it drains an area of 795,000 km2 (307,000 sq mi), discharging 475 km3 (114 cu mi) of water annually.From the Tibetan Plateau the river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult. Even so, the river is a major trade route between western China and Southeast Asia."@en ;
