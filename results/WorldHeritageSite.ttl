The temples are dedicated to the worship of the god Shiva, known under various local names, the most important of which is Bhadreshvara. Mỹ Sơn is perhaps the longest inhabited archaeological site in Indochina, but a large majority of its architecture was destroyed by US bombing during a single week of the Vietnam War."@en ;
